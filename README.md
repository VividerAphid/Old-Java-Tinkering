# Old-Java-Tinkering

A few of some of my Java projects I've done in the past.

##MysterySurvivalWorldGame
A simple little game structure I did experimenting with making a 2D game, focusing on my class structure mostly. Looking in to a 
better version soon.

##ClickCon
A basic Java version of [ClickCon](https://crinoid-cart.000webhostapp.com/aboutPageProfessional.html), where I was experimenting with
trying another language that was better for graphics and rendering. Ultimately, JavaScript won the show, as it was able to do more of
what I needed for the project.
